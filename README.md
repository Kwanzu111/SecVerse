# 🔐 Cybersecurity Learning Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity repository — built for mastering **Python**, **C++**, and **Shell scripting** through real-world security and forensics projects.

> 💡 This repo is part of my long-term goal to build **Secverse**,  focused on offensive security, automation, and cloud AI defense.

## 🧭 Study & Build Roadmap

### 🐍 Python 
-  Learn scripting fundamentals
-  Automate security tasks (e.g., port scanner, dirbuster, log parser)
-  Work with `subprocess`, `socket`, `argparse`, `scapy`, `requests`
-  Publish tools with usage help and clean output (color/styling)
-  Build phishing simulation scripts
-  Interact with Shodan, VirusTotal, or Whois APIs

### 🐚 Shell Scripting 
-  Learn Bash fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals
-  Automate Linux tasks (e.g., update checks, backups, scanning wrappers)
-  Log cleanup, syslog analysis, and scheduling with cron
-  Create an all-in-one setup.sh for pentesting environments

### 💣 C++ 
-  Learn C++ syntax, pointers, memory management
-  Create low-level red team tools (e.g., simple backdoors, keyloggers)
-  Practice buffer overflows (simulated labs)
-  Use system libraries like `<unistd.h>`, `<sys/socket.h>`
-  Build and compile with `Makefile`

### 🧪 Tools & Labs (`tools/`)
-  Step-by-step guides and exercises for:
  - Nmap, Hydra, Nikto, sqlmap
  - Wireshark, TCPDump, Ettercap
  - Volatility, Autopsy (forensics)
  - Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite
  - Custom VM test environments
